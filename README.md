## ABOUT
- This repository contains Online Coding Internship related to Data Analytics using Python Domain.
- **Internship Mode-** Online Coding Internship
- **Internship Duration-** 2 Weeks
- **Time Taken-** 70 hours

- In this internship, I successfully completed the two projects within the time-frame.
- The following two projects are mentioned below with the links.
<br />

## Project 1: **PERFORMING ANALYSIS OF METEOROLOGICAL DATA**
<br />

**Goal-** 
>Our goal is to transform the raw data into information and then convert it into knowledge and to perform data cleaning, perform analysis for testing the (given) Hypothesis i.e. *The Null Hypothesis Ho is “Has the Apparent temperature and humidity compared monthly across 10 years of the data indicate an increase due to Global warming”*.<br />
The Ho means we need to find whether the average Apparent temperature for the month of a month say April starting from 2006 to 2016 and the average humidity for the same period have increased or not.*This monthly analysis has to be done for all 12 months over the 10 year period*.
<br />

**Dataset-** https://www.kaggle.com/muthuj7/weather-dataset

*(The dataset has hourly temperature recorded for last 10 years starting from 2006–04–0100:00:00.000 +0200 to 2016–09–09 23:00:00.000 +0200. It corresponds to Finland, a country in the Northern Europe.)*

## Project 2: **RECOGNIZING HANDWRITTEN DIGITS USING SCIKIT-LEARN**
<br />

**Goal-** 
>Our goal is to involve predicting a numeric value, and then reading and interpreting an image that uses a handwritten font. You can choose a smaller training set and different range for validation and get 100% accurate predictions, but this may not be the case at all times. Perform data analysis to accept the Hypothesis, if it predicts the digit accurately 95% of the times or else reject it. Run for at-least 3 cases , each case for different range of training and validation sets.
<br />

**Dataset-**<br />
**The Digits Dataset:**

(*The scikit-learn library provides numerous datasets that are useful for testing many problems of data analysis and prediction of the results. Also in this case there is a dataset of images called Digits. This dataset consists of 1,797 images that are 8X8 pixels in size. Each image is a handwritten digits in grayscale, as shown in these Figure.*)
